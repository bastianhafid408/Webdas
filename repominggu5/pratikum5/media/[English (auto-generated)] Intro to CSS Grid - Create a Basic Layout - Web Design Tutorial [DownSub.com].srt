00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:04,560
hey guys hey going in this video I'm

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,269
going to be showing you how to use CSS

3
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:09,389
grid in order to create a basic layout

4
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:12,269
just like this for your web projects so

5
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:15,299
this video is intended for people who

6
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,880
are just starting out using CSS grid and

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,400
basically I'm going to be covering most

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,370
of the main features so that you can get

9
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,380
started and of course start implementing

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,350
a CSS grid for your own web projects so

11
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,350
this right here is the basic layouts we

12
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,480
have a header we have some content

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,609
sections and we have of course the

14
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:38,640
footer so basically this layout is going

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,609
to support this right here so this sort

16
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:44,909
of two column content layout as well as

17
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:47,550
a three column content layout just like

18
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,859
this so there's a small change in the

19
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:52,499
CSS in order to transform this right

20
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:55,079
here into this right here so of course

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,659
you can choose which one suits your

22
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:00,780
scenario better so anyway let's go

23
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,170
inside this HTML file right here we're

24
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,969
gonna start from scratch to create that

25
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:09,090
layout so inside the text editor it

26
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,939
looks something like this it is a plain

27
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,990
HTML skeleton so first to get started we

28
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,680
need to of course specify HTML so let's

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,469
create a container so a div with a class

30
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:25,590
of container for the actual grid

31
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,329
container so then inside the CSS let's

32
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:33,359
just firstly target the body and set a

33
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,520
margin of zero to remove the default

34
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,810
margin this way I can say container so

35
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,329
tighter the class of container and say

36
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,359
width and make this 100 review port week

37
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,060
and for the height we can say 100 and

38
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,039
viewport height and of course the

39
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:52,439
combination of these three means that

40
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,450
the container is going to take up the

41
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,090
entire width and height of the web page

42
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,869
so now saving this and refreshing inside

43
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:03,179
the dev tools if I was to hover over the

44
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:05,670
container we can see it spans the entire

45
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,060
width and the height of the available

46
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,129
viewing area I'm also just going to go

47
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:13,860
back inside here and specify some font

48
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,060
styling

49
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,450
to make things easier for us to read so

50
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,060
font-family let's make this quick sand

51
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,780
with sand sir and for the font weight

52
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,680
let's make this bold and also a font

53
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,830
size of something like 20 pixels so now

54
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,150
that is all set so we can now move on to

55
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,120
actually using a CSS grid so for this we

56
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,340
need to firstly specify that our

57
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,489
container is gonna be a grid or a grid

58
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:47,850
container for this we can say display

59
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,150
and make this grid so now we are ready

60
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,060
to start adding some grid items or at

61
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,570
least specify our layer so now I just

62
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,810
want to go back to the previous layout

63
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,420
right here because I now of course our

64
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,390
grid right here is ready to actually be

65
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,090
used we need to specify the amount of

66
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,560
columns and the amount of rows and also

67
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,010
their sizes for our base layer that's

68
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,079
basically how grid works you've got this

69
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:22,200
base grid layer of rows and columns in

70
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,690
the background and then once your layout

71
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,269
is complete you can say that certain

72
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:29,220
elements are going to span multiple rows

73
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,230
or multiple columns or even a

74
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,630
combination of the two so with that

75
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,400
being said let's go back to this example

76
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,700
and analyze and take a look at our

77
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,480
columns and rows for this layer as we

78
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,510
can see here in terms of rows we've got

79
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,600
four rows in total we've got one row

80
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,109
we've got two rows three rows and then

81
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:56,160
four rows okay even though this content

82
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,190
right here is spanning multiple rows we

83
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,590
still consider this to have a total of 4

84
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,030
rows 1 2 3 and then 4 in terms of

85
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,940
columns this actually has three columns

86
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,790
even though two are visible we've got

87
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,670
one we've got two and we've got three

88
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,820
that's easier to explain on this example

89
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,010
right here with the three column layer

90
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,430
one two and three so with that being

91
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,420
said this is a four by three layer

92
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,760
which means we can specify this in the

93
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,510
CSS for our example or this right here

94
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,510
so in the CSS let's hop inside the

95
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,710
container and we're gonna say down here

96
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,980
grid template columns and this right

97
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,870
here lets us specify the amount of

98
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,260
columns and also their sizes so we're

99
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,970
going to say 1 FR 1 FR and then 1 FR so

100
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,490
here we're specifying three columns

101
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,060
since we have three values separated by

102
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,210
a space and the width of those columns

103
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:07,020
is one fraction of the total remaining

104
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,020
space so basically we've got three

105
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,690
evenly spaced columns which are going to

106
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,420
shrink in size as we shrink our browser

107
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,000
because it is a fraction of the

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,090
available space okay and that is all for

109
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:24,440
the columns if you wanted to simplify

110
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,200
this declaration you could instead save

111
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,880
repeats then 3 and then your value so 1

112
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,090
fr and basically doing this is the exact

113
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,250
same as saying what if I wanna fire and

114
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,700
then one afar so now we can specify the

115
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,680
amount of rows for this we're gonna say

116
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,620
grid template rows in a very similar way

117
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,960
and for this it's going to be a bit more

118
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,330
complicated but not too much

119
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,700
so let's go back in the example and we

120
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,430
can see right here of course got the 4

121
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,940
rows the header row is 50 pixels in

122
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:05,040
height ok these two right here are gonna

123
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,590
be the same height but they're gonna be

124
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,230
once again a fraction of the available

125
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,290
space and the bottom one here is 100

126
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,380
pixels fixed so essentially the top and

127
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,600
the and the actual bottom rows are going

128
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,750
to be fixed heights of 50 and 100 pixels

129
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,660
and these two are gonna be a fraction of

130
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,390
the left or remaining space which means

131
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,060
if I was to shrink this browser height

132
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,360
we can see that only the two middle rows

133
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,000
are changing their height the header and

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,690
footer remain fixed so for this let's go

135
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,070
back inside here

136
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,020
we're going to say 50 pixels for the

137
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,280
first row and then one fr or one fr and

138
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,460
then 100 pixels for the bottom row of

139
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,120
course these two are absolutes and these

140
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,610
two are fractional and they can shrink

141
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:00,330
if they need to when the browser resizes

142
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,670
so now we've specified the columns and

143
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,100
the rows I can save this and then

144
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,670
refresh the browser inside the dev tools

145
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,830
if I was to hover over the container we

146
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,890
can see that Chrome gives us a

147
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,290
representation of our layer of course we

148
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,060
can see we have all of our rows and

149
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,350
columns working perfectly fine so now we

150
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,080
can move on to specifying a gap between

151
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,170
each one of our areas here so for this

152
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,630
it is very straightforward we can simply

153
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,810
say gap and make these 10 pixels for

154
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,930
example saving this and refreshing gives

155
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,600
us this right here of course a 10 pixels

156
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,320
gap excluding the edges of the container

157
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,440
if you wanted to add a 10 pixels gap on

158
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,380
the edges this can be done using padding

159
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,900
and then box-sizing let's go back inside

160
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,420
here and do that so we can say paddle

161
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,400
make this 10 pixels the same as the

162
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,370
actual gap size and box sizing our

163
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,130
border box to contain the padding as

164
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,440
being part of the total width of the

165
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,290
container let's save this and now we

166
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,080
have this right here which is identical

167
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,050
to our container in both of these two

168
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,150
examples so now essentially we are

169
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,520
finished with the container I do want to

170
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,160
go back inside here and just add a new

171
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,090
rule set for container and then do so

172
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,890
I'm gonna say padding here and make

173
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:32,190
these 10 pixels and say border at 1

174
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,710
pixel solid and then a black so now

175
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,610
essentially every great item so header

176
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,039
and all the content and the footer each

177
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,539
one of those divs are gonna have a

178
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,090
border I'm sorry I can actually see how

179
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:48,120
they look and how many rows and columns

180
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,210
they span so now so now let's move on to

181
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,700
creating the header we can make a new

182
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,460
div with a

183
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,890
I'll slap it on and just say head up as

184
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,520
the content so now if I save this and

185
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,310
refresh we can see that the header is

186
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,610
taking up a single column and a single

187
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,690
row in terms of its size okay so to make

188
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,510
the head a spend the remaining rows so

189
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,370
row number sorry our column so column

190
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,860
number two and column number three this

191
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,260
can be done using the grid column start

192
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,370
and the grid column end properties so

193
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,670
let's go inside here and I'm gonna say

194
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:31,209
for the class file header reads poem

195
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:34,570
start and make this one and say grids

196
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,970
column end and make this four

197
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,490
so to explain what the one and the four

198
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,370
means basically here you're specifying

199
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:47,230
the grid line number so a grid line is

200
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,290
basically alliance between your rows and

201
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,839
your columns so I'm gonna be showing you

202
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:55,330
what that means right now so in the

203
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:59,110
browser as we can see here we've got a

204
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,830
total of four grid lines on the

205
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,770
horizontal sorry on the vertical axis we

206
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,370
have right here at the edge this is grid

207
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,430
line number one we then have grid line

208
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,790
number two right here and then grid line

209
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,580
number three just about here and then

210
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,410
line number four just about here okay

211
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,510
that's very important to understand when

212
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,240
it comes to making your items span

213
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,370
multiple rows or multiple columns the

214
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,950
same goes for the horizontal axis okay

215
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:36,190
we of course have grid line number one

216
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:40,329
just up here okay number two and then of

217
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:43,209
course number three number four and then

218
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:46,120
number five just down here so that is

219
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,270
what our main bar grid lines so when I

220
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,060
specify a grid column start at one and

221
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,940
end before I mean that the header is

222
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,120
gonna start at number one add fish

223
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,880
number four so now saving this and

224
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,360
refreshing gives us this right here for

225
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,820
further clarification if I make this

226
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,070
grid column end

227
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,030
se3 save this and refresh we can see now

228
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:17,220
it goes to 3 so 1 2 and then 3

229
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,310
ok so perfect so let's just set this

230
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:24,660
back to be 4 yeah so now we can move on

231
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:29,040
to creating the content right here so

232
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,070
this is where I'm gonna I'm gonna first

233
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,770
show you how to do these two columns for

234
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,140
this content number 1 and then after

235
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,880
that I'll be showing you how to change

236
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,190
that so it actually expands so I so

237
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,770
actually spans two rows and then two

238
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,070
columns just like this one okay so back

239
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,340
inside here let's specify our two more

240
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,800
elements for each one of those content

241
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,250
areas so I can say right here a class of

242
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,430
content - large and we can say right

243
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:03,060
here content number one and make this a

244
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,900
and then make this B so with this right

245
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,570
here if I save this and refresh we can

246
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,060
see it is successfully flowed across to

247
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,480
the second row and the actual items

248
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,110
themselves are once again taking up a

249
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,960
single piece of area so single row in a

250
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,750
single column okay so now we're gonna

251
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,300
simply in a very similar way to the

252
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:27,990
header

253
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,760
we're gonna make these to span multiple

254
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,700
rows so you may have guessed we're going

255
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,790
to be using the grid row start and the

256
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,270
grid row ends to achieve that let's

257
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,180
target the content large class and make

258
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,600
this breed a row start we can make it

259
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,660
start of course at number two and a grid

260
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,150
the row ends and this time I'm going to

261
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:56,430
be using span - so basically span - is

262
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,910
an alternative to specifying an actual

263
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,420
grid line number and let's just save

264
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,370
this and refresh we can see we get this

265
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:08,160
result right here so of course the grid

266
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,630
row start was two so this second grid

267
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:17,070
line right here and we used span so when

268
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,710
I said span - it basically means we're

269
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,000
going to start here

270
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,870
then span two lines of course span we

271
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,540
have line number three right here and

272
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,060
then line that before just down here so

273
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,820
started two and then span two gives us

274
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,830
this result but here of course as an

275
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,400
alternative I could simply just say fall

276
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,380
instead of using the span to it works

277
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,810
the exact same way it saved this refresh

278
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,930
and of course we get no different so

279
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:48,630
I'll just set this back to being span

280
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:52,590
two so now if we want to make this so

281
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:56,670
this single content our spans also you

282
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,070
know this second column here just like

283
00:13:59,070 --> 00:13:59,970
this one

284
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,640
this can be done quite easily I'm just

285
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,340
going to be removing this second content

286
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,610
item and making this simply content

287
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,940
number one so now we can go inside here

288
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,390
and we can also say grid column start

289
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:19,830
and make this one and then grids column

290
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,200
end and make this three so essentially

291
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,900
we're combining both the grid row and

292
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,810
the greedy column so now I'll save this

293
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,330
and refresh and we can see right here we

294
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,780
start at column number one and we finish

295
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,950
at column number three right here and of

296
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,280
course the row spanning is still in

297
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,620
effect so now we get this large box

298
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,260
spanning multiple rows and then multiple

299
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,770
columns so now moving on to the tiny

300
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,990
boxes on the right side here this is

301
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,420
going to be very straightforward we're

302
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,760
gonna simply create two more elements so

303
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,330
content small and also content small

304
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:04,020
adjust here and for this we can say

305
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,150
content number two and then content

306
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,900
number three save this and of course

307
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,750
these ones also flow naturally so

308
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,970
they're in the correct spot and that is

309
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,570
awfully small content items so for the

310
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,490
foot out it's gonna work in the same way

311
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,320
as they head out but I'm gonna be

312
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,380
showing you a different way to specify

313
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,260
your column spans so back inside here

314
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,900
let's create the element for the footer

315
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,890
so with their class of

316
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,040
just like this and this CSS rule says

317
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,460
four footer is gonna say greet - Poland

318
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,860
and we're gonna say one forward slash

319
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,190
and then spam to read so for this this

320
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:48,930
is basically just shorthand for saying

321
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:54,790
grid column starts at one and grid

322
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:58,300
column end at span three so basically

323
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,060
this right here is the equivalent to

324
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,540
this right here you separate your start

325
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,480
and your end with a forward slash

326
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,690
so now saving this and refreshing is

327
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,600
gonna give us this result right here

328
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,310
exactly what we want I might just go

329
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,480
back and make this actually save footer

330
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,370
so one last thing I want to show you is

331
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,040
going to be the combination of the grid

332
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,500
templates on the container in a very

333
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,620
similar way as we did right here so for

334
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,130
this we can simply say grid template and

335
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,990
we're going to firstly specify the row

336
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,900
so basically this guy right here then a

337
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,000
forward slash and then say repeats three

338
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,760
1fr just like this so now this right

339
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,120
here in a similar way to this one this

340
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,670
is the exact same as saying this right

341
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,610
here it is simply just a shorthand so

342
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,710
now getting rid of this is going to give

343
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,620
us the exact same result let's save this

344
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,960
and refresh and we can see about he of

345
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,140
course we get the same result and that's

346
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,300
how to create a basic layer from scratch

347
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,089
using CSS grid thanks for watching guys

348
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:10,379
and I'll see you later
